    "vi": "# Exploring the Essentials of HTML: An Introduction to Webpage Structures\n\n## Topic Overview and Actualization\n\nHi there! Today, we embark on your web development journey with **HTML** — **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage, the cornerstone of any webpage. Just as bones provide structure to the human body, HTML structures web pages. By the end of this lesson, you should understand how webpages are structured and create your first HTML webpage.\n\n## Introduction to the Internet and Web Pages\n\nThe Internet is a colossus of interconnected computers. When you type a website address, or URL, into your web browser, the browser requests the webpage from a computer known as a server. The server, in turn, sends back the requested webpage to your browser. Webpages are written in `HTML`, which your browser reads and translates into structured pages that you see when browsing the web, complete with text, images, and other type of content.\n\n## HTML Basics\n\n`HTML` organizes and structures web content using tags, which are denoted by `<tagname>`. For instance, to create a paragraph of text, we surround the text between an opening `<p>` tag and a closing `</p>` tag. Like so:\n\n```html\n<p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n```\n\nThe opening and closing tags, along with the content together are called an HTML element.\n\nThere are many other tags in HTML used for different purposes. Here are a few:\n\n- **`<h1>` to `<h6>`**: These tags are used to create different levels of headings, allowing content to be divided into sections. The `<h1>` tag is the biggest among them and is used for primary headings, while the `<h2>` is used for sub-headings. Each subsequent heading tag from `<h3>` to `<h6>` represents a progressively smaller heading size and `<h6>` represents the smallest one.\n\n- **`<a>`**: This tag is used for hyperlinks.\n\n- **`<img>`**: This is used to embed images in the webpage.\n\nWe'll go further into these and more in later sections.\n\n## HTML Document Structure\n\nHTML documents consist of sections, each marked by specific tags that serve a specific function in the webpage:\n\n- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Identifies the document as an HTML5 document.\n- **`<html>`**: Encloses the HTML document.\n- **`<head>`**: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, not visible on the page itself but necessary for browsers and search engines. One of the key elements that reside in the `<head>` section is the `<title>` tag.\n- **`<title>`**: The content within the title tag is used as the page title. This is what is displayed in the tab or window title bar of your browser and is crucial for SEO (Search Engine Optimization). A descriptive and relevant title helps users navigate their browser tabs and can improve your website ranking in search engines.\n- **`<body>`**: Hosts the content visible to web users — text, images, links, etc.\n\nHere's a simple instance of an HTML document structure:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My First Webpage</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Welcome</h1>\n    <p>This is my first HTML page!</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nGiven this structure, our browser can read and interpret the HTML to display a webpage complete with a title, header, and a paragraph of text. Note that `<!-- text -->` is the comment syntax in HTML. Comments do not effect your code or show up on the webpage. They are there to leave notes for others who will read your code or your future self.\n\n## Basic HTML Tags and Attributes\n\nAttributes provide extra details about an element, affecting its appearance and behavior. Here are some examples:\n\n**Links**: To create hyperlinks, we use the `<a>` element, along with the `href` attribute which specifies the link's destination.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"https://example.com\">Visit Example</a>\n```\n\n**Images**: The `<img>` element is used to embed images. The location of the image file is specified in the `src` attribute, while the `alt` attribute can provide text if the image fails to load, enhancing site accessibility:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"Description of image\">\n```\n\nIt's important to note that the `<img>` tag in HTML does not require its own closing tag `</img>`. This is because this element is designed not to encapsulate content within it. Such elements that don't require a closing tag are referred to as **void** elements.\n\n## Lesson Summary and Upcoming Practice\n\nCongratulations on completing this introductory HTML lesson! You've grasped the basics: the structure, tags, elements, and attributes. Up next, we will delve into some hands-on sessions where you'll shift from theory to practice. Happy coding!",

    "vi": "# Structuring and Organizing Web Content with HTML Lists, Tables, and Formatting\n\n## Introduction\n\nExcited about diving deeper into **HTML**? Our focus today is structuring web content using HTML. In this lesson, we'll explore HTML lists, tables, and formatting tags. These elements organize and clarify your web pages, enhancing the user experience. Let's get started.\n\n## Exploring HTML Lists\n\nLists offer an efficient presentation of organized information. HTML includes both unordered (with bullet points) and ordered (numbered) lists.\n\n### Unordered Lists\n\nOften, we use unordered lists for text items of equal importance. The `<ul>` tag signifies the list, and the `<li>` tag encloses each item.\n\nConsider this shopping list example:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li>Milk</li>\n  <li>Bread</li>\n  <li>Eggs</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nThis code produces a list with bullet points. Each bullet point introduces a new item, signifying an unordered list.\n\n### Ordered Lists\n\nWhen sequence matters, like in instructions, we use ordered lists. The tag for ordered lists is `<ol>` while `<li>` is for the list items.\n\nHere's an ordered list example representing a cooking recipe:\n\n```html\n<ol>\n  <li>Preheat the oven</li>\n  <li>Mix ingredients</li>\n  <li>Bake for 30 minutes</li>\n</ol>\n```\n\nExecuting this code results in numbered items — a perfect fit for step-by-step instructions.\n\n### Nesting Lists\n\nWhen you need a hierarchical structure, nested lists are handy. For example, a categorized shopping list could utilize nested lists.\n\nHere's how:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li>Fruits\n    <ul>\n      <li>Apples</li>\n      <li>Bananas</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Vegetables\n    <ul>\n      <li>Carrots</li>\n      <li>Broccoli</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nEach nested `<ul>` forms subcategories under the main list items.\n\n## Understanding HTML Tables\n\nTables, invaluable for displaying data in a structured manner, simplify the organization and reading of complex data.\n\nIn HTML, tables use the `<table>` tag. The `<tr>` tag facilitates new rows, and `<td>` is for cells within the rows. Headers use the `<th>` tag.\n\nLet's construct a student grade table:\n\n```html\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Student</th>\n    <th>Grade</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Alice</td>\n    <td>A</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Bob</td>\n    <td>B</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n```\n\nThis creates a clear, tabulated display of students and their grades.\n\n## Formatting Text with HTML\n\nWebpages often need to display formatted text, perhaps for a heading or to emphasize a word. HTML offers tags to achieve this:\n\n- **`<b>`** makes text bold.\n- **`<i>`** italicizes text.\n- **`<u>`** underlines text.\n- **`<s>`** strikes through text.\n- **`<br>`** inserts a line break.\n- **`<hr>`** draws a horizontal line.\n\nFor example:\n\n```html\n<p>This is <b>bold</b> and this is <i>italic</i>.</p>\n<p>This is <u>underlined</u> and this is <s>strikethrough</s>.</p>\n<p>Line 1<br>Line 2</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Above is a horizontal rule</p>\n```\n\nHowever, `<b>` and `<i>` tags are presentational. For a more modern approach, use the `<strong>` and `<em>` semantic tags instead.\n\n## HTML Entities\n\nSpecial characters like `<` or `&` require HTML entities to display.\n\n- `&lt;` for `<`\n- `&gt;` for `>`\n- `&amp;` for `&`\n- `&deg;` for `°`\n- `&copy;` for `©`\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html\n<p>The temperature is 25&deg;C</p>\n<p>&copy; 2024 My Company</p>\n<p>Use &lt;div&gt; for containers</p>\n```\n\n## Lesson Summary and Practice\n\nGreat job! Through this lesson, you've learned to organize and structure **HTML** content using lists, tables, and formatting. Now's the time to cement this learning through real-life exercises — a critical step toward becoming an efficient web developer. Let's start practicing!",

    "vi": "# Dressing Up Your Webpages: Beginning with CSS Styling\n\n## Introducing CSS\n\nHello there! Today, we are venturing into an exploration of **CSS** (**C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets), a language that contributes endlessly to bringing color, life, and structure to webpages. Think about this: once you have constructed a building with bare walls with HTML, CSS becomes the tool that paints the walls, decorates the room, and makes it cozy. Amazing, isn't it? Let's dive in!\n\n## Basic Syntax of CSS\n\nThe syntax of CSS is similar to writing commands for your dog — you choose the dog's name (selector), and then tell it what to do (declarations). For instance, let's create a CSS rule-set:\n\n```css\nh1 {\n    color: blue;\n    font-size: 12px;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `h1` is the selector (our pet), `color` and `font-size` are the properties (commands), and `blue` and `12px` are the corresponding values that indicate how to perform the command. This code makes all `<h1>` elements have a blue text that is `12 pixels` big.\n\n## Connecting CSS to HTML\n\nThere are three ways we can connect CSS to HTML:\n\n### Inline CSS\n\nWe apply styles directly within the HTML element using the `style` attribute:\n\n```html\n<h1 style=\"color: blue; font-size: 12px;\">Hello World</h1>\n```\n\n### Internal CSS\n\nHere, CSS rules reside within the `<style>` tag inside the `head` section of the HTML document.\n\n```html\n<head>\n    <style>\n        h1 {\n            color: blue;\n            font-size: 12px;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n```\n\n### External CSS\n\nFor larger projects, we link separate .css files to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag:\n\n```html\n<head>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n```\n\nAccompanied by the corresponding `styles.css`:\n\n```css\nh1 {\n    color: blue;\n    font-size: 12px;\n}\n```\n\n## CSS Selectors\n\nCSS selectors are used to \"find\" HTML elements based on properties of the elements. There are several different types of selectors in CSS:\n\n### Element Selector\n\nThis targets HTML elements by their tag name. Any style assigned to an element selector will apply to all elements with that tag on a page. For instance:\n\n```css\np {\n    color: red;\n    font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, all `<p>` (paragraph) elements on the page would receive the styles specified (in this case, they will have red text in bold).\n\n### Class Selector\n\nThis targets HTML elements with a particular class attribute. They are preceded by a dot (.) in CSS (The `/*` and `*/` notations used in the code snippet below mark the comments in CSS):\n\n```css\n/* This is a CSS comment */\n.important-text {\n    color: red;\n    font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n\nIn your HTML, you'd then add the class attribute with the value `important-text` to the elements you want affected:\n\n```html\n<p class=\"important-text\">This text is important!</p>\n```\n\nThis class can be reused across multiple elements on your page, allowing them all to share the same styles.\n\n### Id Selector\n\nThis targets a unique HTML element by its id attribute. It is preceded by a hash (#) in CSS:\n\n```css\n#header {\n    background-color: blue;\n    color: white;\n}\n```\n\nAnd, in HTML you'd assign this id to one specific element:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"header\">Welcome to my website</div>\n```\n\nRemember, id is meant to be unique, and should only be applied to one element on a page.\n\nBy mastering these selectors, you'll be able to control the presentation of every element on your page for a beautiful and consistent design.\n\n## Understanding Div and Span Tags, Block-level and Inline Elements\n\n`div` and `span` tags group HTML elements, allowing a style to be applied swiftly to all elements within the group.\n\n### div\n\nThis is a block-level element. By default, block-level elements create line breaks before and after themselves, and occupy the full width of their parent element.\n\n```html\n<div style=\"background-color: yellow;\">\n    <h2>Heading</h2>\n    <p>Paragraph</p>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this case both `h2` and `p` elements will have a yellow background occupying not only the text but the full row.\n\n### span\n\nThis is an inline element, meaning it only occupies necessary space and doesn't cause line breaks.\n\n```html\n<p>This is a <span style=\"color: blue;\">blue</span> word.</p>\n```\n\nNotice that the word \"blue\" is colored in blue. That's the `span` tag at work!\n\n### Key Concepts\n\nTo help you understand this better, let's define some additional terms:\n\n- **Parent and Child Elements:** In HTML, elements are often enclosed within other elements. The enclosing element is called the **parent element**, and the enclosed elements are known as the **child elements**. In the above example, the `div` element is a parent element to the `h2` and `p` child elements.\n\n- **Block-level Elements:** By default, a block-level element starts on a new line, causes a line break after itself, and expands to fill the full width of its parent element. `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>` through `<h6>` are some examples. Though these elements behave this way by default, their behavior can be modified using advanced CSS techniques.\n\n- **Inline Elements:** On the other hand, inline elements do not start on a new line and do not cause a line break after them. They take up only as much width as necessary for their content. Multiple inline elements can be placed next to each other on the same line. Examples of inline elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, etc.\n\nUnderstanding the concepts of parent and child elements, as well as block-level and inline elements, and how to use `div` and `span` tags are essential for effective webpage layout and styling.\n\n## Lesson Summary\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully mastered the basics of CSS. The knowledge you acquired today is the first step towards creating appealing and dynamic webpages. Up next, we have hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding. Remember, practice is the ladder to mastery. Let's dive in and code happily!",

    "vi": "# Mastering CSS: Display Properties and Designing Layouts\n\n## Introduction and Lesson Objectives\n\nHello, learners! Today, we're going to explore important parts of making a website with CSS: the CSS Box Model, Flexbox, and Grid.\n\n* **CSS Box Model**: Think of every piece on your website as a box. The Box Model is what we use in CSS to manage where each box goes, how much space it takes up, and how it interacts with other boxes.\n* **Flexbox**: Sometimes, we want what's in the boxes to adjust itself nicely. This is where Flexbox comes in. Using Flexbox, we can control how elements inside a box align and order themselves.\n* **Grid**: If we want to lay out our boxes in a grid, like a table or a chessboard, the Grid system is the tool we use. It makes complex designs simple, letting us quickly decide what goes in which row or column.\n\nHere's what we'll learn in this course:\n\n* Understand the CSS Box Model and its role in organizing your website.\n* Master the CSS `flexbox` and `grid` systems, becoming pro at how they manage boxes.\n* Practice using these systems to build neat and well-structured web pages.\n\nReady to dig in? Let's go!\n\n## Delving into the CSS Box Model\n\nEach HTML element can be viewed as a box. The `Box Model` encompasses:\n\n* **Content**: The actual element content.\n* **Padding**: The space that surrounds the content.\n* **Border**: The box's perimeter.\n* **Margin**: Space outside the box.\n\nLet's put this into action using a simple paragraph:\n\n```css\np {\n    padding: 20px;\n    border: 5px solid black;\n    margin: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nBy manipulating the padding, border, and margin, you can position and resize HTML elements, which aids in layout design.\n\n## Flexbox Layout Basics\n\nIntroducing **Flexbox**, a layout model that brings harmony and order to your web pages. In a Flexbox layout, all HTML elements find a place with good coordination, much like a Wheelbarrow race! Let's dive into Flexbox!\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flex_demo\">\n    <div>Item 1</div>\n    <div>Item 2</div>\n    <div>Item 3</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n.flex_demo {\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: space-around;\n    align-items: center;\n}\n\n.flex_demo > div {\n    background-color: lightblue;\n    padding: 20px;\n    margin: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nIn this HTML code, we have created a Flex container `.flex_demo` and positioned the child `div` elements evenly and centrally along both axes. Here's what the properties do:\n\n1. `display: flex;` turns the element into a Flex container.\n2. `justify-content: space-around;` controls the alignment of items on the horizontal line in the current line. The `space-around` value means that items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Other possible values of the `justify-content` property include:\n   * `center`: Items are centrally aligned.\n   * `space-between`: There's equal space between each item, but not between the items and the container.\n   * `flex-start`: Items are aligned at the start of the container.\n   * `flex-end`: Items are aligned at the end of the container.\n3. `align-items: center;` aligns flex items along the cross axis of the current line of the flex container. It's analogous to `justify-content` but in the perpendicular direction. The `center` value aligns the items at the center of the container. Other possible values of the `align-items` property include:\n   * `flex-start`: Items align to the top of the container.\n   * `flex-end`: Items align to the bottom of the container.\n\nNow, you might be wondering about the `.flex_demo > div` part. This notation is called the \"child combinator\" (`>`). The `>` combinator selects elements that are direct children of a specified element. In this example, `.flex_demo > div` selects all `div` elements that are direct children of the element with the `flex_demo` class.\n\n## Into the Grid: CSS Grid Layout\n\nNow let's explore the **CSS Grid Layout**, a powerful tool for creating webpage layouts. It arranges the layout into rows and columns, much like pieces in a board game. Intriguing, isn't it?\n\n```html\n<div class=\"grid_demo\">\n    <div>Grid Item 1</div>\n    <div>Grid Item 2</div>\n    <div>Grid Item 3</div>\n    <div>Grid Item 4</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n.grid_demo {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: auto auto;\n    gap: 10px;\n}\n\n.grid_demo > div {\n    background-color: lightblue;\n    padding: 20px;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n```\n\nThe CSS class `.grid_demo` lays out HTML elements in a grid layout, giving a totally new perspective for web layout design. Let's understand this grid layout step by step:\n\n1. `display: grid;` is applied to convert our container element into a Grid layout.\n2. `grid-template-columns: auto auto;` This tells the browser to generate a grid layout with two columns of equal width. The number of times \"auto\" is repeated determines the number of columns.\n3. `gap: 10px;` defines the size of the gap between the rows and columns in the grid.\n4. `.grid_demo > div` is an example of the child selector (`>`) that we discussed previously. In this case, all direct `div` children of `.grid_demo` will have a `background-color` of lightblue, `padding` of 20px, and the text in each division will be centered within its container.\n\n## Lesson Summary\n\nWell done! We've ventured further into CSS, concentrating on learning the ins and outs of positioning elements and designing layouts with powerful techniques like `Flexbox` and `Grid`. Up next, we have practical exercises to solidify this newly gained knowledge. Each progressive step increases our understanding of CSS, empowering us to create feature-rich, aesthetically pleasing web pages. Let's continue learning, and as always, happy coding!",

    "vi": "# Mastering Stylish Web Designs: Positioning, Transitions, and Animations in CSS\n\n## Introduction: Enhancing Web Designs\n\nWelcome, eager learners! In today's exciting web design lesson, we're diving into **CSS positioning**, **transitions**, and **animations**. These dynamic enhancements breathe life into sterile web pages, creating vibrant and interactive digital experiences. Ready to jump in? Let's go!\n\n## Understanding Positioning in CSS\n\nIn CSS, the `position` property controls an element's location on a web page. Here's what different `position` values do:\n\n* **Static:** By default, an element is static, occupying its natural place in the flow of the document.\n* **Relative:** A relative element can move from its natural place based on the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` properties. Other elements still behave as if it's in its original position.\n* **Absolute:** The position is set relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, not from the top of the page.\n* **Fixed:** The element's position is \"fixed\" to the viewport, so it stays in the same place even when you scroll the page.\n\nThe `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties are used in conjunction with all positioning types except static. For relative positioning, these properties will \"push\" the element from its normal position down, left, up, and right respectively. But for absolute and fixed, they position the element at a specific distance from the top, right, bottom, and left edge of its containing element.\n\nHere's an illustration in code:\n\n```css\n.relative-box {\n    position: relative;\n    top: 20px;\n    left: 30px;\n    background-color: #ff6b6b;\n}\n\n.absolute-box {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 50px;\n    right: 20px;\n    background-color: #4ecdc4;\n}\n\n.fixed-box {\n    position: fixed;\n    bottom: 20px;\n    right: 20px;\n    background-color: #ffe66d;\n}\n```\n\nNote that the 7-symbol words in the `border` properties are hexadecimal notations of some colors.\n\n## Getting to Know Transitions\n\nTransitions in CSS let you gradually change property values, creating a smooth effect. By specifying the transition parameters like so:\n\n```css\ntransition: <transition-property> <transition-duration> <transition-timing-function>;\n```\n\nwe require to change the property `<transition-property>` within `<transition-duration>` amount of time (typically accepts values in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms), e.g., `2s` or `2000ms`) using the function `<transition-timing-function>`.\n\nThe timing function can have the following values:\n\n* **'ease'** (starts slow, increases speed, then ends slow)\n* **'linear'** (equal speed)\n* **'ease-in'** (starts slow)\n* **'ease-out'** (ends slow)\n* **'ease-in-out'** (starts slow and ends slow)\n\nThe difference between 'ease' and 'ease-in-out' is that 'ease' speeds up sooner. For example, consider a button that slowly changes from blue to green when hovered over:\n\n```css\n.button {\n    background-color: blue;\n    transition: background-color 0.5s ease;\n}\n\n.button:hover {\n    background-color: green;\n}\n```\n\n`:hover` is called a pseudoclass, that applies a specific style to an element when hovered over. Do not worry if you don't understand it now. We'll go into more detail later on.\n\n## Exploring Animations in CSS\n\nWhile transitions offer basic effects, `animations` allow you to define multiple style changes at various points, creating complex visual effects. Like transitions, they go from one CSS style to another but offer much more control.\n\nAnimations are defined using `keyframes`. Here's an animation example:\n\n```css\n@keyframes slide {\n    0% {\n        left: 0px;\n    }\n    100% {\n        left: 200px;\n    }\n}\n\n.box {\n    position: relative;\n    animation: slide 2s ease-in-out infinite;\n}\n```\n\nLet's take a closer look at the following line:\n\n```css\n0% {\n    left: 0px;\n}\n```\n\nThis is a keyframe. `0%` represents the starting point of one cycle of the animation (`100%` represents the ending point of the cycle, and any percentage in between represents the corresponding point in time within that cycle). The accompanying rule set specifies the CSS property (or properties) that are to be applied at this particular moment of the animation. In this case, the CSS `left` property is set to `0px`, positioning the box at the left edge of its containing element when the animation starts. It's important to note that multiple properties could be defined within these braces, allowing multiple style changes to be animated simultaneously.\n\nWhen adding an already defined animation to the element, we use the following property:\n\n```css\nanimation: <animation-name> <animation-duration> <animation-timing-function> <animation-iteration-count>;\n```\n\n`<animation-name>` is the name of the animation. `<animation-duration>` and `<animation-timing-function>` are similar to the transition parameters. `<animation-iteration-count>` specifies how many times animation repeats, type 'infinite' for endless repetition.\n\nIn some scenarios, you might want your animation to rotate its direction every time it completes a cycle. In that case you add a parameter called `<animation-direction>` to your `animation` property with the value `alternate` in the end. Specifically, the above code can be rewritten in the following way:\n\n```css\n.box {\n    position: relative;\n    animation: slide 2s ease-in-out infinite alternate;\n}\n```\n\n## Lesson Summary and Next Steps\n\nGreat job! By mastering CSS positioning, transitions, and animations, you have taken a significant step forward. Now, get ready for practice exercises to reinforce your knowledge. Keep practicing, and soon, you'll intuitively create visually stunning web designs. Let's proceed!",

    "vi": "# Mastering Adaptive Web Design: Responsive Layouts and Media Queries in CSS\n\n## Introduction to Responsive Web Design\n\nWelcome to an exciting chapter! We know that **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** are the key languages that bring web pages to life. But devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, or smartwatches which are used to view our pages come in various sizes. The solution? **Responsive Web Design**. It ensures that web pages detect the viewer's screen size and orientation and adjusts the layout accordingly. It's similar to words in a book reflowing to fit pages of different sizes. Now, let's delve deeper!\n\n## Understanding Media Queries\n\nTo make your site responsive, you should embrace CSS **Media Queries**. These are instrumental in Responsive Web Design. Media queries implement certain CSS rules when specific conditions are fulfilled. For example, the following is a simple media query that applies a rule when the browser window is less than 600 pixels wide:\n\n```css\n@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n    body {\n        background-color: lightblue;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above segment, `screen` is the media **type** and `(max-width: 600px)` is the **media feature**. It changes the body's background color to light blue when the viewport is 600 pixels wide or less.\n\n## Creating Responsive Layouts with Media Queries\n\nMedia queries modify layouts based on screen size. For example, a webpage layout on a large screen (like a desktop) would differ from that on a smaller screen (like a smartphone). Here's an example:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"sidebar\">Sidebar</div>\n    <div class=\"main-content\">Main Content</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nAnd the corresponding CSS in `styles.css`:\n\n```css\n.container {\n    display: flex;\n}\n\n.sidebar {\n    width: 25%;\n    margin-left: 1%;\n}\n\n.main-content {\n    width: 73%;\n    margin-left: 1%;\n}\n\n@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n    .container {\n        flex-direction: column;\n    }\n    \n    .sidebar {\n        width: 100%;\n        margin-left: 0;\n    }\n    \n    .main-content {\n        width: 100%;\n        margin-left: 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that when we give a value as a percentage, such as `margin-left: 1%;`, it means that the left margin is set to 1% of the total width of the parent element. For example, if the parent element has a width of 800px, a `margin-left: 1%;` on the child element would be equivalent to 8px.\n\n## Mobile-First Approach in Responsive Design\n\nWe can initially structure for big screens and then adapt it for smaller screens. However, in web development, a widely recognized approach is the **Mobile-First Design**. It includes designing for small screens first and then scaling up for larger screens.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate:\n\n```css\n/* Mobile-first: base styles for small screens */\n.container {\n    width: 100%;\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n\n.box {\n    width: 100%;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n/* Tablet and larger screens */\n@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n    .container {\n        padding: 20px;\n    }\n    \n    .box {\n        width: 48%;\n        display: inline-block;\n    }\n}\n\n/* Desktop screens */\n@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {\n    .container {\n        max-width: 1200px;\n        margin: 0 auto;\n    }\n    \n    .box {\n        width: 31%;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this mobile-first approach, we start with styles for small screens (mobile devices), then use `min-width` media queries to add styles for larger screens as needed.\n\n## Lesson Summary\n\nThat concludes our lesson! Today, you've unlocked a key aspect of web development! You've learned about:\n\n* Responsive website design — what it involves and why it is significant.\n* Media queries — why we use them and their syntax.\n* Creating Responsive layouts using Media Queries — how they enhance viewer experience.\n* The **Mobile-First** design approach — how it ensures a better responsive design.\n\nIt's now time to practice. In the upcoming exercises, you'll build a responsive webpage layout that should adapt to different screen sizes. Enhance your web-development skills and explore more in the following exercises! Good luck!",

It includes designing for small screens first and then scaling up for larger screens.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate:\n\n```css\n/* Mobile-first: base styles for small screens */\n.container {\n    width: 100%;\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n\n.box {\n    width: 100%;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n\n/* Tablet and larger screens */\n@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {\n    .container {\n        padding: 20px;\n    }\n    \n    .box {\n        width: 48%;\n        display: inline-block;\n    }\n}\n\n/* Desktop screens */\n@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {\n    .container {\n        max-width: 1200px;\n        margin: 0 auto;\n    }\n    \n    .box {\n        width: 31%;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this mobile-first approach, we start with styles for small screens (mobile devices), then use `min-width` media queries to add styles for larger screens as needed.\n\n## Lesson Summary\n\nThat concludes our lesson! Today, you've unlocked a key aspect of web development! You've learned about:\n\n* Responsive website design — what it involves and why it is significant.\n* Media queries — why we use them and their syntax.\n* Creating Responsive layouts using Media Queries — how they enhance viewer experience.\n* The **Mobile-First** design approach — how it ensures a better responsive design.\n\nIt's now time to practice. In the upcoming exercises, you'll build a responsive webpage layout that should adapt to different screen sizes. Enhance your web-development skills and explore more in the following exercises! Good luck!"

    "vi": "# Interactive Web Development with JavaScript and DOM\n\n## Introduction to JavaScript and DOM\n\nWelcome aboard! In today's lesson, we are exploring the dynamic duo of **JavaScript** and the **Document Object Model** (DOM). Working in tandem with the DOM, we can manipulate and update our web pages in real-time based on user interactions.\n\nDo you remember how some websites greet, \"Good morning!\" during the day and \"Good night!\" after sundown? This dynamic behavior is exactly what we aim to achieve using JavaScript and DOM.\n\n## Linking JavaScript to HTML\n\nTo introduce JavaScript into HTML, we need the `<script>` tag. Although JavaScript can be written directly inside HTML, it's often tidier to store it in separate files:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <p id=\"greeting\">Hello</p>\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nInline `<script>` tags also serve as an option:\n\n```html\n<script>\n    document.getElementById('greeting').innerHTML = 'Hello, World!';\n</script>\n```\n\nThe `innerHTML` property is a powerful tool that allows us to get the content of elements or directly insert content into elements in our HTML. In the code above, we used `innerHTML` to change the text content of a paragraph.\n\n## Understanding DOM Manipulation\n\nAtomic yet immense, DOM manipulation is achievable via JavaScript. This tool offers us the ability to grasp elements and perform operations on them much like a craftsman working on his creation. Here are some handy methods for DOM manipulation:\n\n* **`document.getElementById(id)`**: This function fetches an element using its unique ID, much like how you would find a book in a library.\n* **`document.getElementsByTagName(name)`**: It selects all elements that share a specified tag name, such as all paragraphs (`<p>`).\n* **`document.getElementsByClassName(name)`**: This function retrieves all elements having the provided class name.\n* **`document.querySelector(selector)`**: Just as you pick out your favorite fruit from a basket, it selects the first element that matches the supplied CSS selector.\n\nSelectors that return multiple elements (`getElementsByTagName` and `getElementsByClassName`) return a JS array of elements, so you need to select which element in the list you want through array indexing.\n\nBelow, we have an illustration of how we can select an HTML element and modify its content and style:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>DOM Manipulation</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1 id=\"title\">Original Title</h1>\n    <button onclick=\"changeTitle()\">Change Title</button>\n    \n    <script>\n        function changeTitle() {\n            var titleElement = document.getElementById('title');\n            titleElement.innerHTML = 'New Title';\n            titleElement.style.color = 'red';\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe `<button>` tag in HTML is used to create a clickable button on your webpage. Contained within the opening and closing `<button>` tags, you can place text or images. This content is what users see and click on. The `onclick` attribute is an event attribute that instructs the browser to execute a specific JavaScript function when the button is clicked. The function to be executed is specified right within the `onclick` attribute.\n\nIn this case, once the button is clicked it triggers the `changeTitle()` method. Within this method, we're setting the `style.color` property of `titleElement`. `titleElement.style.color = 'red';` alters the CSS color of the text within this element to red.\n\nUsing getElements or querySelector to access an element is just the starting point. Once you have the reference to an element, there are many things you can do to manipulate it.\n\n* **Modifying content**: As you've seen with `innerHTML`, after selecting an element, you can directly manipulate its content.\n* **Changing style**: You can change any CSS property of an element using `element.style.property`. This covers a range of alterations from colors, dimensions, positioning, to transitions, transformations and visibility. **Note**: In JavaScript, CSS property names that contain a hyphen (like `background-color`) are converted to camelCase (becomes `backgroundColor`). This is due to the fact that hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript variable names.\n\n## Manipulating Elements\n\nModifying content via `innerHTML` and changing style via `element.style.property` is just the beginning. Look at more options of manipulating elements.\n\n* **Adding or removing classes**: You can add a new class to an element with `element.classList.add('className')` or remove a class with `element.classList.remove('className')`.\n* **Setting or getting attributes**: You can change any attribute of an element using `element.setAttribute('attrName', 'attrValue')` or retrieve it with `element.getAttribute('attrName')`.\n* **Event handling**: With a reference to an element, you can attach an event listener that will execute a specified function when the event occurs, using syntax like `element.addEventListener('click', function)`. Note that when adding an event, the function does not require `()` like `onclick`.\n* **Creation and deletion of elements**: Using methods such as `document.createElement('tagName')` to create an element or `element.removeChild(childElement)` to remove a child element.\n\nThe `document.createElement('tagName')` will create an empty element with the tag name you provide. However, when an element is created like this, it does not automatically appear on the webpage. To make it visible, you have to append the new element to an existing element on the page using `appendChild()`. The `appendChild()` method places a node as the last child of its parent. With `appendChild()`, you can also dynamically add new content to your document.\n\nWith just a few keystrokes in JavaScript, voila, you've transformed the entire persona of your webpage!\n\n## Lesson Summary\n\nGreat job, future web wizards! You have now mastered the art of manipulating web pages using JavaScript and the DOM! From linking JavaScript to your HTML, understanding how to select elements using methods like `getElementById`, `getElementsByTagName` and `querySelector`, to dynamically updating these elements by changing their content, style, attributes or even adding and removing them.\n\nYou've learned how JavaScript can interact with the DOM to update your webpages in real-time, providing the ability to create a rich and interactive user experience that can respond to user inputs and actions dynamically.\n\nNext up are practice exercises for you to apply this newfound knowledge and help turn this knowledge into an intuitive understanding. Then, in future lessons, we'll venture into more advanced topics and broaden your understanding of JavaScript and web development as a whole.\n\nBuckle up and let's continue to explore the wonderful and exciting world of JavaScript and web development!",

Here are some handy methods for DOM manipulation:\n\n* **`document.getElementById(id)`**: This function fetches an element using its unique ID, much like how you would find a book in a library.\n* **`document.getElementsByTagName(name)`**: It selects all elements that share a specified tag name, such as all paragraphs (`<p>`).\n* **`document.getElementsByClassName(name)`**: This function retrieves all elements having the provided class name.\n* **`document.querySelector(selector)`**: Just as you pick out your favorite fruit from a basket, it selects the first element that matches the supplied CSS selector.\n\nSelectors that return multiple elements (`getElementsByTagName` and `getElementsByClassName`) return a JS array of elements, so you need to select which element in the list you want through array indexing.\n\nBelow, we have an illustration of how we can select an HTML element and modify its content and style:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>DOM Manipulation</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1 id=\"title\">Original Title</h1>\n    <button onclick=\"changeTitle()\">Change Title</button>\n    \n    <script>\n        function changeTitle() {\n            var titleElement = document.getElementById('title');\n            titleElement.innerHTML = 'New Title';\n            titleElement.style.color = 'red';\n        }\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe `<button>` tag in HTML is used to create a clickable button on your webpage. Contained within the opening and closing `<button>` tags, you can place text or images. This content is what users see and click on. The `onclick` attribute is an event attribute that instructs the browser to execute a specific JavaScript function when the button is clicked. The function to be executed is specified right within the `onclick` attribute.\n\nIn this case, once the button is clicked it triggers the `changeTitle()` method. Within this method, we're setting the `style.color` property of `titleElement`. `titleElement.style.color = 'red';` alters the CSS color of the text within this element to red.\n\nUsing getElements or querySelector to access an element is just the starting point. Once you have the reference to an element, there are many things you can do to manipulate it.\n\n* **Modifying content**: As you've seen with `innerHTML`, after selecting an element, you can directly manipulate its content.\n* **Changing style**: You can change any CSS property of an element using `element.style.property`. This covers a range of alterations from colors, dimensions, positioning, to transitions, transformations and visibility. **Note**: In JavaScript, CSS property names that contain a hyphen (like `background-color`) are converted to camelCase (becomes `backgroundColor`). This is due to the fact that hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript variable names.\n\n## Manipulating Elements\n\nModifying content via `innerHTML` and changing style via `element.style.property` is just the beginning. Look at more options of manipulating elements.\n\n* **Adding or removing classes**: You can add a new class to an element with `element.classList.add('className')` or remove a class with `element.classList.remove('className')`.\n* **Setting or getting attributes**: You can change any attribute of an element using `element.setAttribute('attrName', 'attrValue')` or retrieve it with `element.getAttribute('attrName')`.\n* **Event handling**: With a reference to an element, you can attach an event listener that will execute a specified function when the event occurs, using syntax like `element.addEventListener('click', function)`. Note that when adding an event, the function does not require `()` like `onclick`.\n* **Creation and deletion of elements**: Using methods such as `document.createElement('tagName')` to create an element or `element.removeChild(childElement)` to remove a child element.\n\nThe `document.createElement('tagName')` will create an empty element with the tag name you provide. However, when an element is created like this, it does not automatically appear on the webpage. To make it visible, you have to append the new element to an existing element on the page using `appendChild()`. The `appendChild()` method places a node as the last child of its parent. With `appendChild()`, you can also dynamically add new content to your document.\n\nWith just a few keystrokes in JavaScript, voila, you've transformed the entire persona of your webpage!\n\n## Lesson Summary\n\nGreat job, future web wizards! You have now mastered the art of manipulating web pages using JavaScript and the DOM! From linking JavaScript to your HTML, understanding how to select elements using methods like `getElementById`, `getElementsByTagName` and `querySelector`, to dynamically updating these elements by changing their content, style, attributes or even adding and removing them.\n\nYou've learned how JavaScript can interact with the DOM to update your webpages in real-time, providing the ability to create a rich and interactive user experience that can respond to user inputs and actions dynamically.\n\nNext up are practice exercises for you to apply this newfound knowledge and help turn this knowledge into an intuitive understanding. Then, in future lessons, we'll venture into more advanced topics and broaden your understanding of JavaScript and web development as a whole.\n\nBuckle up and let's continue to explore the wonderful and exciting world of JavaScript and web development!"

All rights reserved.</p>\n</footer>\n```\n\n## Complete Layout Example\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Semantic HTML Layout</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <header>\n        <h1>My Website</h1>\n        <nav>\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"/about\">About</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </nav>\n    </header>\n    \n    <main>\n        <article>\n            <h2>Article Title</h2>\n            <p>Article content goes here...</p>\n        </article>\n        \n        <section>\n            <h2>Related Section</h2>\n            <p>Section content...</p>\n        </section>\n    </main>\n    \n    <aside>\n        <h3>Sidebar</h3>\n        <p>Additional information...</p>\n    </aside>\n    \n    <footer>\n        <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>\n    </footer>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Comparison with Div\n\n**Before (non-semantic):**\n```html\n<div id=\"header\">...</div>\n<div id=\"main\">...</div>\n<div id=\"footer\">...</div>\n```\n\n**After (semantic):**\n```html\n<header>...</header>\n<main>...</main>\n<footer>...</footer>\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nSemantic elements make HTML code clearer, easier to understand, and improve SEO and accessibility. Use them instead of `<div>` when possible!"
